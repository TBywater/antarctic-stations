                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        Antarctica is the southernmost continent on Earth. It is also the coldest, driest and windiest and is noted as being the last one to be discovered, in 1820.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first confirmed landing in Antarctica occurred in 1895. Some nations have territorial claims in Antarctica but the <b>territory is de facto shared, primarily to conduct scientific experiments</b>. To enable scientific work, a number of stations have been built on the continent. Depending on the season, <b>population in Antarctica ranges from around 1,000 to 5,000 people</b>. This is because some stations only operate in the summer, while others are active all year round.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve long been fascinated by Antarctica. It’s a very isolated place with an extremely harsh environment, where, against all odds, humans have managed to dwell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to find out more about research stations in Antarctica: <b>how many there are, where they are located and when they opened</b>, so I made the interactive map above.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Making the map</h2>
                    <p>
                        The map was made using <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> (an awesome user interface framework) and <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Data sources</h2>
                    <p>
                        I scraped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_stations_in_Antarctica">the list of stations from Wikipedia</a>; the additional information shown in tooltips I also got from individual Wikipedia pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Geodata comes from Natural Earth. I took <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/">Cultural Vectors</a> as a source for land data, which I then filtered to include only Antarctica and exported as TopoJSON using <a href="https://mapshaper.org/">Mapshaper</a>. For the ice layer I used the <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/50m-antarctic-ice-shelves/">Ice Shelves</a> data.
